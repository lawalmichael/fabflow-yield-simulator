# Fab Process Simulator

## Project Overview
This project is a simplified semiconductor fabrication process simulator designed to model and analyze key manufacturing steps such as plasma etching, deposition, and process variation. The goal is to provide an educational and practical tool for understanding how process parameters impact yield, uniformity, and throughput in a fab environment.

## Features
- Simulates basic fab process steps
- Models process variability and defects
- Visualizes yield and process performance metrics

## How to Run (Placeholder)
Instructions for running the simulator will be added once the initial implementation is complete.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas (optional)

## Future Improvements
- Add equipment-level modeling
- Introduce statistical process control (SPC)
- Expand to multi-step fab workflows
